// This provides an extremely lightweight library format.
// It's designed to easy to create and parse (by hand or machine).
// The library has no header, and each line starts with the p.n.;
// any text after the first whitespace on a line is ignored.
// It is particularly intended as a convenient way of piping data
// between stdout and stdin of consecutive programs in a pipeline.
