			      MethSearch
                              ----------

MethSearch is a program for generating an exhaustive list of methods matching
a given set of criteria.  It can also be used as a tool to assist in finding 
particularly musical or interesting method.

  --offset-cyclic        Require offset cyclicity


-L libraries should be either Central Council method libraries or MicroSIRIL
method libraries.  (CC libraries are recommended as they allow spaces in 
method names and are updated more frequently.)  CC libraries are obtainable 
from

   http://www.methods.clara.net/method-collections/zip-files/index.htm

It is often a good idea to use -u with long searches so that you have some
idea how far the search is progressing.  This also means that, if necessary,
you can restart the search using --start-at.

The --rev-cyclic-hle, --rev-cyclic-hlh, --cyclic-hle, --cyclic-hlh and
--regular-hls options may be used in combination to mean that one of them
must match.  The --regular-hls option requires that the half lead-heads and 
ends are the same as the half-lead heads and ends of Plain Bob (although 
it is permitted for the methods half-lead head to be the half-lead end of 
Plain Bob and vice versa).

The -E (--prefer-restricted-le) option will only include methods with lead
end changes other than 12 or 1N if neither the 12 nor the 1N version conforms
to the required criteria.  This is the same restriction that the CC applies
in, say, the Plain Minor Collection.



Falseness Options
-----------------

The -F option checks some property of the method's falseness.   The TYPE
argument to the -F option specifies what property to check.  Each argument
has a long form and a short form.  If no -F option is given, -Fl is assumed.

  e, extent	      Require a extent to be potentially possible (see below)
  e+, positive-extent Require an in-course (half-)extent to be potentially 
                      possible (see below)
  CPS		      Require the method to be clear proof scale
  c, course           Require the plain course to be true
  l, lead             Require a lead to be true [default]
  h, half-lead        Only require a half-lead to be true
  n, none             No requirements on the truth of the method
  x, really-none      As 'n' but even allowing 'trivial' falseness (see below)

With the exception of -Fe each option implies all of the options below, and
should not be used with any lower options.  -Fe and -Fc are orthogonal and
may both be specified (extents may be possible in methods that are false 
in the plain course).  -Fe, -Fe+ and -Fc all imply -Fl.

Note that even with -Fn certain 'trivial' falsenesses are excluded:  the 
change where no bells cross (123456 on 6 bells) is still forbidden, and 
methods containing the same change twice in succession are also forbidden
(e.g. Surprise methods beginning -.-.-.14).  To find methods with these
'trivial' falsenesses, use the -Fx option (probably in conjunction with the 
-h option).

It is worth being aware that the use of -Fe and -Fc can have a significant
impact on the speed of a search.  

Note that -Fe does not search for an extent of the method, it merely checks
to see whether there exists a set of mutually true leads including each row
in the extent exactly once.  This is necessary (although not sufficient) for 
an extent using single change, lead-end calls to exist.  The -Fe option is
only currently implemented for single-hunt plain methods.  The -Fe+ option
does the same but only for the in-course lead-heads / -ends, thus for a 
treble-dodging minor method it will check whether there are 30 true in-course
leads.



Format Specifiers
-----------------

The -H and -R formats accept the following format specifiers:

  $[N]c  The number of matching methods ( -H only );  if a number, N, is 
         specified, it is the minimum width of the field
  $l     The lead head
  $d     The lead head code
  $p     The place notation (-R only).
  $q     The place notation (-R only), but in a slightly more compressed 
         format
  $Q     The place notation minus the lead-head change (-R only), 
         in the slightly more compressed format
  $Nr    The Nth row in the lead -- N should be an integer starting at 0
  $Nh    The Nth change in the lead -- N should be an integer starting at 1
  $[N]b  The maximum number of consecutive blows in one place;  if a number,
         N, is specified, it is the minimum width of the field
  $[N]o  The number of leads in the method;  if a number, N, is specified,
         it is the minimum width of the field
  $[N]u  The number of hunt bells in the method;  if a number, N, is specified,
         it is the minimum width of the field
  $NP    The path of the bell N -- N should be an integer not a bell symbol
  $n     The method's name (minus class and stage); requires a -L option
  $N     The method's full name (including class and stage); requires -L
  $C     The class of the method
  $S     The stage name of the method (e.g. 'Major')
  $[N]M  The musical score for the course;  if a number, N, is specified, 
         it is the minimum width of the field
  $F     The in-course, tenors together falseness groups
  $$     A literal $
  $[...] An expression (-R only); see below

\t and \n are interpreted as a tab and a line break respectively,
although in some situations these are interpreted by the shell and so will
need to be written \\t and \\n respectively.  (Although, typically it will 
do the same thing if the shell interprets it, so this is not particularly
important.)  A trailing \ in a format string suppresses the line break 
between entries.  In this case, it is important to ensure that the shell
does not interpret this and so it will probably need escaping from the shell
with an extra back-slash.

For backwards compatibility, % is allowed as an alternative to $ in 
format specifiers.

The $F option is only currently supported for -sr or -kc searches and only
on 8 bells.  For regular, symmetric searches, these have the obvious names; 
for the names of rotationally symmetric cyclic falseness groups see table 
supplied.



Expressions
-----------

A -R format may include an expression delimitted by $[ ... ], this allows
more complicated expressions to be built up.  The argument to --require is 
an expression in the same format, except it is not delimited by $[ ... ].
The operators provided is modeled loosely on those in Perl's; they are 
listed below from highest to lowest precedence.

  Associativity   Operators
  left            *  /  %
  left            +  -
  left            <  >  <=  >=  lt  gt  le  ge
  left            ==  !=  eq  ne
  left            &&
  left            ||
  right           ?:
  
The arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) operate on integers with rounding
done towards zero -- thus 3/2 is 1 (rounding is towards zero).  The modulo
operator, a % b, computes the value of a modulo b, thus 5 % 2 is 1.
Parentheses can be used to override the natural precedence and associativity 
of operators in the usual way.  

The numerical comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) convert their 
arguments to integers before doing the comparison.  If their arguments were
not integers (e.g. they are string literals), a run-time error will be issued.
(Runtime errors are errors that happen when the expression is actually
evaluated; to avoid aborting the entire search when such an error occurs,
an expression that issues a run-time error will produce the string <ERROR>.)
The string comparison operators (lt, gt, le, ge, eq, ne) are like the
corresponding numerical ones, but convert their arguments to strings (which
can never fail).

Like the numeric comparison operators, the logical operators (&&, ||) 
first convert their arguments to integers.  They then treat 0 as false and
anything else as true.  The ternary operator (?:) evaluates its first 
argument as a boolean (like the logical operators) and then, if it was true, 
evaluates and returns its second argument, or, it was false, evaluates and
returns its third argument.

Integer literals may be included in the expression, as may string literals
(which must be double quoted).  Variables may be accessed as $p, etc.  
Currently the avaliable variables are the same as those listed under format
specifiers, above.



Music Patterns
--------------

The -M option accepts a pattern.  Each row in the plain course is tried  
against each pattern and if it matches the score is incremented.  Thus, if 
a row matches more than one pattern it will be counted multiple times.  The
pattern is a simple type of regular expression. 

  1234567890ETABCD...	  Match that particular bell
  *			  Match any number of unspecified bells, including 
			  none.
  ?			  Matches exactly one unspecified bell.
  <name>		  Matches some special named sort of music (see below)

Various named rows can be searched for using the -M'<name>' syntax:

  queens		  Searches for queens
  kings			  Searches for kings
  tittums		  Searches for tittums
  reverse-rounds	  Searches for reverse-rounds


The -M<name> syntax also provides short-hands for counting CRUs with,

  -M<CRUs>          which counts the number of CRUs in the plain course, and
  -M<N-runs>        which counts the number of N-bell runs (either ascending 
                    or descending).  (N should be an integer between 3 and 
                    the number of bells.)
  -M<front-N-runs>  which counts the number of N-bell runs (either ascending
                    or descending) from the front of the change. (N should 
                    be an integer between 3 and the number of bells.)
  -M<back-N-runs>   which counts the number of N-bell runs (either ascending
                    or descending) from the back of the change. (N should 
                    be an integer between 3 and the number of bells.)


Note that -M<4-runs> will multiply count rows with longer runs in them; thus, 
for example, 21345678 will be counted three times one for each subsidiary 
run of four bells (3456, 4567 and 5678).  This means that in an extent on 
eight bells has a total <4-runs> score of 1200 and not 1002.

Note that depending on your shell you may need to quote or escape the < and >
characters to prevent the shell from using them for redirection.  One of the 
following styles will probably work in most shells:

  -M'<queens>'  -M"<queens>"  -M\<queens\>  "-M<queens>"  '-M<queens>'


The * and ? metacharacters can be used to describe other types of music, 
for example, -M'*5678' searches for roll-ups, and -M'8765*' searches for a 
reverse roll-up on the front.  The -M<name> options can all be constructed 
using this notation, for example, -M'<CRUs>' on 8 bells is equivalent to

  -M'*5678' -M'*6578' -M'*4678' -M'*6478' -M'*4578' -M'*5478'

(Again, careful quoting and/or escaping of * is needed to prevent the shell
from interpretting it.)

Prefixing any pattern with a number followed by a colon allows a weighting 
to be specifed.  For example,

  -M'<4-runs>' -M'4:*5678' -M'4:*6578' -M'4:*7568' -M'4:5678*'

scores 96 particularly pleasing <4-runs> from the total 1200 with five times
the weight (five not four as they were counted once by -M<4-runs> anyway).



Method Masks
------------

The -m option can be used to supply a mask that a method must match.  At its
simplest, a mask is just a method place notation.  Thus -b6 -m'&-4-3.234.5,2'
lists just Armitage Bob Minor.  The syntax for place notations is fairly 
flexible:  a '.' only need be used where it is necessary to separate two 
non-cross changes, although may be used to separate any changes; external
places can be left implicit; the cross change may be specified '-', 'x' or 
'X'; and the symbols for bells may be specified in upper or lower case.  

The '&' symbol specifies that the following place notation, upto the next 
comma (or the end) is a symmetric block.  Thus, '&-4-3.234.5,2' is short 
hand for '-4-3.234.5.234.3-4-2'.  The '&' needn't be at the start of the 
place notation, for example, the place notation of Grandsire Major can be 
written '3,&1-1-1-1-' (note the comma before the ampersand).

As well as just containing place notation, a mask may also use the '?' and '*'
metacharacters, which respectively represent exactly one and zero or more 
unspecified changes.  So, for a plain minor method the mask '-?-?-?-?-?-?' 
is equivalent to the -w (right-place) option.

  The '*' symbol may be used at
most once in a mask (because otherwise the notation between the two '*'s 
would be moveable), and methsearch uses the -b and -G (where present) options
to work out how many '?'s to expand this to.  

The -m option can also be used to specify the above or below work.  This
is done by separating the above and below work using a '/'.  Thus to search 
for plain doubles methods with Reverse Canterbury above the treble, one 
would use the mask '&345.1.5.1.5/*,2'.   Within masks, the slash "operator" 
has higher precedence than the comma, thus each separate comma-separated 
section can have its own above/below works specified.  Alternatives may be
included within an above or below work, e.g. -m'&(5|345).1.5.1.5/*,2'.

It is perfectly legal to put arbitrary places below the treble (provided the 
change formed is a legal change) in the above work, and similarly, arbitrary 
places above the treble in the below work -- they are simply ignored.  Thus
the Reverse Canterbury above work mask could equally have been written 
'&345.1.5.123.5/*,2'.  

The symbol '*' may be used at most once in any above or below work section.
If both the above and below work section both contain a '*', or if a combined
above - below work section (i.e. one without a '/') contains a '*', 
methsearch will use the -b and -G options to work out how many '?'s the '&'
expands to.  This means that only one such '*' is permitted.  



Examples
--------

  methsearch -b6 -p2 -sre -L PLAIN6.TXT -R"$p [$N]"

This prints all Plain Minor (-b6) methods with conventional symmetry (-s), 
regular lead heads (-r), 12 or 16 lead end changes (-e), no more that two 
consecutive blows in any one place (-p2).  It prints out the place notation 
($p) and the full method name ($N), using the library PLAIN6.TXT in the current
directory to find the names.  The output begins

X.16.X.36.X.36.X.36.X.16.X.16. [College Bob Minor]
X.16.X.36.X.36.X.36.X.16.X.12. [St Clement's College Bob Minor]
etc...



  methsearch -b6 -p2 -srfS -p2 -LPLAIN6.TXT -R '$n  [$q]'


This lists the twelve minor methods from the above list that have Court places
around the treble (-S works for plain methods too), and which have no 56s in 
the place notation (other than at the half lead).

London  [&-4-3-5,6]
Double Oxford  [&-4-3-5,2]
Double Court  [&-4-3-1,6]
Hereward  [&-4-3-1,2]
Lytham  [&-4-3.2.5,6]
Thelwall  [&-4-3.2.5,2]
Westlecott  [&-4-23-5,6]
Pinehurst  [&-4-23-5,2]
Frodsham  [&3.4-3-5,2]
Bala  [&3.4-3.4.3,2]
Windermere  [&3.4-3.2.5,2]
Helvellyn  [&3.4-23-5,2]



  methsearch -b6 -kc -qH"$3c\t$5r"

This finds all methods with 'Brave New Worlds' symmetry and cyclic lead ends, 
and finds out what their hand-stroke half-lead changes are (the 5th row of 
the method: the initial rounds is the 0th row).  It prints out a table of the 
relative frequencies of each hand-stroke half-lead change:

 95     234561
 29     456231
 44     623451
Total: 168



  methsearch -b6 -PSG1 -fsr -p2 -l2 -L SURP6.TXT -R"$n"

This lists the names of the 'Standard' 41 Surprise Minor methods.  Note 
however that because of the issues mentioned below, the program is probably 
not very useable with treble-dodging methods in general.  A mask option,
for example, -m'&-3-4-2-3*,2' can be used to further reduce the number of 
methods found.  This particular mask will only select those of the 41 which
have Cambridge above the treble.



  methsearch -b4 -s

This shows the 11 symmetric Plain Minimus methods.  Removing the -s option 
finds an additional six asymmetric methods, although these go away again 
if -Fc is added.  (These six methods are false in the plain course.)



Issues
------

The following functionality does not exist in the methsearch program.

  * Extent length.  At some point I might add some options to filter out
    methods that cannot produce extents (because of their falseness) or 
    cannot produce a peal-length composition.  This would be particularly
    useful for Surprise Minor where methods which cannot give 720s are
    of very limited use.  It would also remove the need for the -P option.
    This will be rolled into the -Fe option.

  * Music.  There's still a long way to go with the code to evaluate the
    musical potential of a method.  In the long run I'd like to be able to 
    write -M"*{4+}*" to find runs of four or more bells in descending pitch,
    or -M"*[456][456]78" to find CRUs.

  * Falseness.  There are some serious opportunities for optimization in 
    the handling of -Fc, -Fl and -Fe options.

  * Masks.  I might also get around to adding a short-hand for repeated 
    symbols, e.g. ?{5} for ?????.


Comments & suggestions welcome.
